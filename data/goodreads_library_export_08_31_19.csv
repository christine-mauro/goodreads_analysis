The most common of these is her simultaneous desire to not be seen, but at the same time, to be seen.  She is also spends a lot of time discussing her struggle to reconcile her parents' image of her as a ""good"" girl with who she was forced to become as a result of being raped at 12.  I am also glad that she acknowledged how privileged she was compared to others: attending one of the best high schools in the country, having parents who were always there despite not knowing until recently the reasons behind her extreme behavior, to name just two.  One of my favorite quotes from the book (transcribed from the audio version) was: <i>""We talked about the goings on of the world, we talked about we wanted for ourselves. I took it for granted that this is what all families did. Come together and become an island unto themselves, the kitchen table the sun around which we revolved"". </i>(Chapter 14)",,,1,,,0,,,,,

There is a large cast of characters, all of whom are written with such detail that you feel like you know them personally. Although this book focuses entirely on Beartown, a small town in Sweden (?), it could be any town in any part of America.

Novik did an amazing job of writing the Wood as the antagonist.  The fear and creepiness of the Wood was very believable.

A desire to understand both the magic and the Wood made me want to keep reading.  On the other hand, after finishing the book, I still had lots of unanswered questions about both which frustrated me.  I also though the book dragged at some points and was a bit too long.  <spoiler> Lastly, the romantic relationship between Agnieszka and the Dragon wasn't well developed.

Some of the take away points for me were: 1) Being creative is inherent to being human; human beings were creating long before even agriculture/farming began. Creating is an important part of living a fulfilled life. 2) You should focus on the process, not necessarily the product. It doesn't matter how good you are if it brings you joy (to drag [a:Marie Kondō|5589647|Marie Kondō|https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1451520607p2/5589647.jpg] into this). 3) Done is better than good.  As a perfectionist, this one really struck home for me! 4) You shouldn't rely on your creative endeavors to support you financially.  This very rarely happens and can end up destroying your urge to create. 5) Follow your curiosity; not all great ideas are ""inspired"" but rather come from continuous movement forward.

The first point she made was regarding the media coverage of DJT, which even though mostly negative, far exceeded coverage of her.  This is an example of ""any publicity is good publicity."" The other interesting point is that the media spent 3 times as much time covering her email scandal than any of her policies combined.  The most interesting point came at the end of the book when she discusses how Americans are now less involved in churches, community organizations, teams, etc.  Because of this, they no longer feel like they are a part of something bigger and are dissatisfied with their circumstances, leaving room for people like DJT to fill the gap. I've heard about this phenomenon before (most recently in Johnathan Haidt's The Righteous Mind).  Figuring out how to reconnect people with each other is probably one of the most important tasks we face going forward as a society.  Social media/cell phones/technology is not the answer.  Lastly, HRC spent considerable time talking about her relationships with her mother, daughter, and grandchildren. Because of this, I felt much more connected to her while reading this book than I ever did while she was a candidate. Where was this side of her on the campaign trail? Maybe it was there but overshadowed by all of the email and DJT coverage? ",,,1,,,0,,,,,
